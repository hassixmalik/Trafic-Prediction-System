# Trafic-Prediction-System
Trafic Prediction using Saletile images (Using Google maps Screenshots for now as i can't affoed the Google API).
A brief detail about project:
In this implementation, the GA optimizes the kernel size used in the morphological operations for red line detection. The fitness_function calculates the fitness score based on the number of red lines detected. The GA loops through multiple generations of selection, crossover, and mutation to find the best chromosome with the highest fitness score.
